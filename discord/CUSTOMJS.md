### Custom JS
Allows users to create and execute custom JS inside of desktop app's environment by adding scripts to the addon directory.  You can use this functionality to add custom CSS or any other functionality you want!  

The desktop app's HTML and CSS are identical to the stuff used on the web app, so you can mine for the information you need there!  Also, you can get a developer console similar to chrome's up on windows via `Ctrl+Shift+I`.  Hack away!

NOTE:  Your js files MUST be encoded as `utf-8`.  If you don't know what that is, odds are it doesn't affect you, so don't worry too much about it.

* Windows users add `.js` files here: `%APPDATA%/discord/bpm/custom`
* Mac users add `.js` files here: `~/Library/Preferences/discord/bpm/custom`
* Linux users add `.js` files under `PATH_TO_DISCORD_INSTALL/bpm/custom`
